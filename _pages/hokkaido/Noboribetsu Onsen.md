My first two weeks are in Noboribetsu, an onsen town in Hokkaido. The onsen town itself is fairly unassuming, with a few large hotels and essentially just one small high street. Other than that, there's a few walks to see the hot springs, and a few lakes.

My first week was spent almost entirely trying and failing to get over jet lag and establish a somewhat regular sleeping pattern. What actually happened was a lot of me falling asleep for a few hours in the late morning/early afternoon, missing my window to get out and about, then waking up at 2am every morning, unable to get back to sleep.

One side effect was that it was very easy to wake up in time for my Japanese lesson on Thursday - it was the last lesson of term and since I'd already paid for it I decided to dial in remotely. The class is 6:30-8:30pm local time, which in Japan is 3:30-5:30am. I'd been awake for an hour before class started.

The onsen itself is very pleasant if you like that sort of thing. No photos or videos to share for obvious reasons, but it's pretty much what you'd expect from a public hot springs bath. Maybe a bit more man-made feeling than I was expecting, but still was really nice. They have an outoor part as well, where you get a nice cool breeze to contrast the warm waters.

Temperatures this week have ranged from -6 to 7°C, but it's felt warmer. So far I haven't needed my big coat, making do with a thermal top and a couple of fleeces. There was one day where there were 40mph winds but I just stayed inside that day, seemed like the sensible thing to do.

Food has been good too, I haven't been particularly adventurous so far though. Have been leaning heavily into the [hotel breakfast](/2026-02-17-Natto), and a few snacks during the day courtesy of the local 7-11 and protein shakes. People reading this my wonder why I'm supplementing protein when there's so much food available for me to try. There's a few reasons:
1. Convenience. I'm not actually that motivated to go outside much, partly because of jetlag lingering, and partly because of the weather and having to put on all my layers.
2. Health buffer - I'm here for ages, so I can't really get away with a 'holiday diet' the whole time. This way I can set a bit of a floor for how much protein I'm getting in, and hopefully limit muscle loss and fat gain. Once I settle in Tokyo the idea is for me to continue improving my fitness.
3. Enjoyment - You know how when you have too many treats it stops being enjoyable? If I maintain a reasonably healthy base, I enjoy it more when I do go out to eat.

I tried 7-11 fried chicken the other day. It lived up to the lofty expectations that were set. Cup noodles also good. Melon soda also good. Hokkaido milk also good, tastes different to ours. Maybe fattier? Gyoza is next on my list I think. And ramen.

I'm also just relearning that junk food is really tasty. like crisps and chocolate and stuff. Not a big revelation I know. I'll probably just try a few things here and there to see what's out there. Don't want to get too fat though. It also does make me just feel a bit worse, like less energy and worse mood.

Overall I feel like I'm still just slowly easing my way into Japanese life. Haven't been crazy adventurous yet, but it's been enjoyable nonetheless. The people here don't seem to speak much English, or at least don't try by default. It's good because it stops me from being lazy and forcing my listener to use whatever English they have. That being said I could be making more effort to talk to people. When I move to bigger cities, apparently English speaking is more common, so I will probably have to make more of a concious effort to use Japanese, for example at conbini.

I'll probably just share an album at the end of my Hokkaido trip with photos, I expect they'll all be fairly similar thematically.
