Arrived in Hokkaido Monday night. Flight was London Heathrow to Tokyo, then a couple of hours layover in Tokyo before a short flight to Sapporo.

I'm staying in Noboribetsu, which is an onsen town south of the main city Sapporo.

Flights were fine, pretty uncomfortable but all flights are for me. Just never enough legroom.

When I arrived in Sapporo, I didn't have a plan for how to get to my hotel. It's about an hour's drive, so a taxi would probably have been really expensive, but this was my plan A. My flight was due to arrive at 9:30ish so I couldn't take one of the shuttle buses, they only run once or twice a day.

Technically my plan A was just to ask someone at the information desk what they think I should do, but turns out it was closed for the night.

I could also take a couple of trains to Noboribetsu, but again with the late hour this wasn't guaranteed as trains stop around 11.

I ended up deciding to take a train, as Google maps assured me there was one at 22:17, which gave me plenty of time in theory. One stop and then change to a train that takes me to Noboribetsu. There was also about 10 minutes between the trains, so gave me time in case I got lost.

Buying train tickets was surprisingly easy. Once I'd finished staring at a ticket machine  that turned out to be for buses, I headed down to the JR rail station at the airport, and bought my tickets from the ticket machine, payed by card, nice and easy. Put my ticket through the reader at the gate and I was on my way. Train was ¥4340 which is about £21.

Next came the tricky part. When I arrived in Noboribetsu, I was hoping to get a taxi up the road to the hotel. The train station was deserted, I was the only passenger to get off, and no trains arrived after mine. There were no staff either, again closed for the night. Everything was left open though, which felt weird. I stood at the taxi rank, in the cold, saw a couple of cars drive past that were definitely not taxis.

It didn't take me long to realise that nothing was going to come, so I resorted to my taxi app, Go, which I'd set up while waiting at Tokyo airport, along with my eSim. However, the app was showing no available drivers, which at 11:30pm in a foreign land in below freezing conditions, was far from ideal.

I decided to call the hotel, they'd have someone who speaks English, and can call me a taxi and I'd be there in no time. Except the hotel staff didn't speak English.

I fumbled my way through a conversation with the staff, who in fairness was very helpful. I explained that I arrived at Noboribetsu station, but can't get a taxi. He started saying stuff and I didn't really understand, but I did understand him talking about a taxi company, he might have said that part in English though, and he gave me the number of a company I could call. I got a bit confused about whether he said he'd call for me or I should do it myself so I asked to clarify, but if I was thinking clearly I would have realised it would be strange for him to give me a number and then call it himself for me. I was tired ok give me a break.

Next I called the taxi company, again in Japanese. This guy seemed a bit better at talking at my language level, because I could understand more of what he said. Again I explained that I was at the station and needed to get to my hotel, after a quick check he told me there would be a 30 minute wait. Sure enough, just over half an hour later, a taxi came to pick me up and I was at the hotel 15 minutes later. Taxi was ¥3100, so around £15. 

Totel travel from airport to hotel came to about £36 which, compared to a taxi which would likely have cost me in the £100s, I was pretty happy with.

Wasn't particularly fun stood waiting for the taxi though, I had my barefoot shoes on and just a fleece as my layer, so even waiting in a little building by the taxi stop I got cold. [Short video of me waiting](https://youtube.com/shorts/-FvSvxh01Wo?si=BCwMj4iJSDbjigkk)
