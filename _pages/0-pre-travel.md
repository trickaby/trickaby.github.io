Here's a picture of fog. I'm just using it as a placeholder. Pretty cool though right?

Ok so packing is nearly done, not much else to do before flying on Sunday.

Been practicing some cycling, which I haven't done any of since school. Went alright. 
I'm planning to do the [Shimanami Kaido](/spring_travels/onomichi/) in Onomichi.
