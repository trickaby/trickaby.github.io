Okay let's get one thing out of the way. I'm not a writer by any means and I'm not going to try and write well.
I'll basically just type what I'm thinking and if it doesn't make sense then oh well.

If there's anything you didn't understand, then that's ok. Sometimes it rains on Sundays.

I do like this place to feel a bit clunky and homemade.

You may also notice the inconsistent/illogical naming convention of these posts' titles.
This is a feature, not a bug.
