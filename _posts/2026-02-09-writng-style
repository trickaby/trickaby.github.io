Okay let's get one thing out of the way. I'm not a writer by any means and I'm not going to try and write well.
I'll basically just type what I'm thinking and if it doesn't make sense then who cares.

If there's anything you didn't understand, then that's ok. Sometimes it rains on Sundays.

I do like this place to feel a bit clunky and homemade. It's kinda just a vibe.
More a form of self expression than communication.

You may also notice the inconsistent/illogical naming convention of these posts' titles.
This will continue, or hopefully get worse over time.
