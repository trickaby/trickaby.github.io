So continuing with the setup, it's getting more complicated, probably more so than I'd like. 
Just trying to get a decent nav and file structure, but it's a bit fiddly and I don't really know what I'm doing

Update: ok I've got something working, it's super clunky but kinda in a good way. Gonna manually make my contents home page and just update it when I post new stuff. Posts will probably be informal and unstructured
